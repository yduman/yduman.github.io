      <description>In one of my last posts, I shared the announcement of Hooks by the React team with you. About two weeks ago, the React team finally released the Hooks API with version 16.8. In this blogpost I want to share one approach of how to use the useContext Hook along with useReducer in order to create and update context. I will not explain how the Context or Hooks API work. If you are not familiar with them, then please read the documentation.</description>

      <description>So yesterday ReactConf started with the opening keynote of Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov about “React Today and Tomorrow”. Dan Abramov introduced Hooks, which is currently in React v16.7.0-alpha and in a RFC status. I was really hooked (pun intended) about the new possibilites with the new API and many library developers immediately started to try it out and they were amazed too.&#xA;Why Hooks? Link to heading The React team observed over time, that it is hard to reuse stateful logic between components.</description>
