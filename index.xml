      <description>The original post is written in German on the MaibornWolff website.&#xA;The following is a plain translation of it.&#xA;In this blog post, I want to introduce you to Preact. About a year ago, I had the opportunity to test it during a spike. As a React fan, it was exciting to try out a good alternative, and I was impressed by its performance. Recently, the new version 10, &amp;ldquo;Preact X,&amp;rdquo; was released, bringing additional new features.</description>

      <description>In one of my last posts, I shared the announcement of Hooks by the React team with you. About two weeks ago, the React team finally released the Hooks API with version 16.8. In this blogpost I want to share one approach of how to use the useContext Hook along with useReducer in order to create and update context. I will not explain how the Context or Hooks API work. If you are not familiar with them, then please read the documentation.</description>

      <description>So yesterday ReactConf started with the opening keynote of Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov about “React Today and Tomorrow”.

I was really hooked (pun intended) about the new possibilites with the new API and many library developers immediately started to try it out and they were amazed too.&#xA;Why Hooks?
