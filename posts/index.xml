      <description>The original post is written in German on the MaibornWolff website.&#xA;The following is a plain translation of it.&#xA;In this blog post, I want to introduce you to Preact.

Recently, the new version 10, &amp;ldquo;Preact X,&amp;rdquo; was released, bringing additional new features.</description>

If you are not familiar with them, then please read the documentation.</description>

      <description>So yesterday ReactConf started with the opening keynote of Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov about “React Today and Tomorrow”. Dan Abramov introduced Hooks, which is currently in React v16.7.0-alpha and in a RFC status.
