Hey, I'm Yadu. Welcome to my digital garden! Everything that you see here is written by me and revolves around my own opinion and findings. The purpose is to share knowledge and sometimes some non-trivial topics that you usually encounter in real life projects. 

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [MaibornWolff](https://maibornwolff.de). Over the years, I found a passion for creating tailored software together with talented people.

I work primarily in a full-stack/cross-platform landscape, using any programming language that does the job. Apart from coding, I am also coaching people, helping them grow in their career. It's a great experience, since both parties learn from each other!

I also care a lot about communication in my work. In my opinion, it's a crucial puzzle piece for successful projects, which is why I encourage everyone in my team to be proactive in this space.
